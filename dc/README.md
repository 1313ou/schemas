# WordNet Metadata Attributes

The Global WordNet Association allows metadata attributes to be
embedded within a wordnet document. The following fourteen attributes
are inspired by the [Dublin Core](http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/)
Metadata Element Set and have the same usage, and for this and
historical reasons (see below) they appear with a `dc` namespace
linked to this document.


## Schemas

The metadata attributes described in this document are used by the
following schemas:

- [WN-LMF 1.1](http://globalwordnet.github.io/schemas/WN-LMF-1.1.dtd)


## Inventory of Attributes

The following fourteen attributes may be used in wordnets. For a
description of their purpose, follow the links to the description of
the corresponding Dublin Core elements.

##  Note

Previously the `dc` namespace linked directly to Dublin Core, but it
was changed because the WordNet Metadata Attributes do not use the
Dublin Core elements as specified, but only its conceptual framework.
